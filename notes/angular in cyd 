## components
I perfer angular-strap to Bootstrap JS. That provides me with single Angular experience with Bootstrap CSS. 

### navigation bar

[angular-strap navbar](http://mgcrea.github.io/angular-strap/#/#navbars)

* modal (show from top when users click on **sign up** or **log in**)     
	[angular-strap modal](http://mgcrea.github.io/angular-strap/#/#modals). This solution is not satisfactory as the modal is the child of the navigation bar and they will have the same `z-index`. That's not good as they will either be both masked by backdrop or be both in front of backdrop.
