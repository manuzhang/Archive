Pintos programming project from CS140@stanford

Pintos is a simple operating system framework for the 80x86 architecture. 
It supports kernel threads, loading and running user programs, and a file system, 
but it implements all of these in a very simple way. 

In the Pintos projects, I will strengthen its support in all three of these areas. 
I will also add a virtual memory implementation.
