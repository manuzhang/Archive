the bochs simulator seems to be problematic
use qemu instead
qemu is installed locally so that the project won't be self-contained

the old version of bochs(2.2.6) can't be compiled with g++
the newer version gives the following error:

Writing command line to /tmp/VaVP0BRIm_.dsk...

successfully compile QEMU from source and install it into the ./bin directory
now the project is self-contained with renaming qemu-system-i386 to qemu

invoking thread_block and thread_unblock will fail the alarm-simultaneous; but this will not happen when invoking sema_up and sema_down

the problem is not about which functions are invoked but how "le" finds its next elem (thread.c:129); when an elem's time expires and is removed from list its next elem can no longer be accessed. In that case, the next elem is the return value of list_remove

some test fails in some occassion while passes in others
